All todos
Mock recorder
ItemCollectionMetrics are implemented in some places (maybe batching or transact ops) but not others
remove aws from serailziation and lambda projects


Features
 * Look through IAmazonDynamoDb comments for any exception descriptions and apply (for example resource not found exception)
 * Search for ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure
 * Add any missing service quotas https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ServiceQuotas.html
 * When building a DynamoDBEvent.DynamodbStreamRecord
    * EventVersion is not set
    * If TTL is ever set, the UserIdentity property must be set. It has comments on how
 * Remove dependency on dynamodb. Replace with compilation

Tests
 * Do a giant fuzz tester of all expressions

Optimisations/refactoring
 * PrecedenceProcessor.fs: Optimize this whole file + Parser.fs they are are a hot path
 * Revisit compiler caching
 * ScanCompiler 
	* List index projections. Allocates a new array for each add (search for AttributeList)
 * Str: asContexted, indentComplex, indent methods. These seem inefficient
 * clean up of test host helpers
 * GlobalDatabaseState.fs: messy needs cleanup
 * AstCompiler
    * Recursion limit still exists: search for ExpressionCompilerRecursionlimit
    * Removed all of the todos about non cached and lazily constructructed things. There are more efficiencies to be found there but they need to be discovered with more logging
